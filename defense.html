        <h1>LEARN TO DEFEND</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="paragraph">
        <p>Defense might not be the most glamorous part of basketball, but it is every bit as important as offense. One of the myths of great defense, however, is that players must be fast and quick to be effective defenders. In fact, the best defense is played with anticipation and awareness of whatâ€™s going on around you, good body balance and basic fundamentals. Great defense also demands great effort.</p>
        <p>Good defense puts great pressure in the opponents offensive strategies. Breaking these offensive strategies induces a higher rate of turnover, resulting in a change of possession of the basketball. Once the ball is changed from the opposing team to your own team, it allows your team to employ offensive strategies.</p>
