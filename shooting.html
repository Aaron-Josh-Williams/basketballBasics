        <h1>LEARN TO SHOOT</h1>
    </div>
    
    <div id="paragraph">
    <p>Shooting is the most important skill in basketball. The fundamental skills of passing, dribbling, defense, and rebounding may enable you to get a high percentage shot, but you must still be able to make the shot. A large part of shooting is mental attitude. In addition to shooting skill, you must have confidence in yourself to shoot well. The integration of the mental and mechanical aspects of shooting fosters shooting success.</p>
    <p>Development of an accurate shot forces your defender to play you tight and become vulnerable to a fake, allowing you to pass and drive as well as shoot. If you lack an accurate shot, a defender can play back in anticipation of a drive or a pass and be less susceptible to your fake. When you do not have the ball, your defender can play farther off you and be in better position to give defensive help to a teammate guarding another player. To be successful, a team must have players who can make the outside shot.</p>
