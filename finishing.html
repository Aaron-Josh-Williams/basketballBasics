        <h1>LEARN TO FINISH</h1>
    </div>

    <div id="paragraph">
        <p>Being able to capitalize and finish the opportunities that you get at the rim is a separator that differentiates good teams from great teams. It is almost a coaching cliche to say “if we make layups we will win the game”, and there is some truth to that statement. Because of various situations that a player may find themselves in during a game situation, it is vital that they are able to execute multiple finishes around the rim.</p>
        <p>Finishing around the basket is something that players of all sizes and positions should spend time working on. Depending on size and athleticism, it will be naturally easier for some players to be better finishers than others. However, a player who knows how to use their body and can be crafty can be a high-level finisher regardless of size.</p>
