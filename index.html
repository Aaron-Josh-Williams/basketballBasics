        <p> This website was made to help the people who do not have easy access to a coach who can help them improve their athletic abilities. Families with low income are much more likely to give up on sports than families with a higher income. We saw that most kids who were not good at a sport, instantly gave up rather than trying to get better at it. As a result, a lot of possible future athletes are not made. Our website allows these kids to have easy access to such materials and will allow them to compete with other kids. As a matter of fact, they'll be able to compete at a higher level and it can start a persons professional career.</p>
