        <h1>LEARN TO DRIBBLE</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="paragraph">
        <p>Since the dribbler is the player with the ball, they are the most important player at that moment. The dribbler has the power to make a play happen and has to make the decision on what to do. The dribbler should become a triple threat to the defender, meaning they can pass, dribble, or shoot at any moment to make that defender's job more difficult.</p>
